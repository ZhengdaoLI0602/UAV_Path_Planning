# Relationship between the scripts (demonstrated in the Methodology of report)
![Scripts_Hierarchy](https://github.com/ZhengdaoLI0602/UAV_Path_Planning/assets/80500317/b8f17488-0b54-4dd6-b4d8-a37dce73a0d0)



# How to run the scripts
1. Run "Main1_d_Bar_Determination.jl", to make test on finding displacement limit
2. Without clearing the cache, run "Main2_Area_Maximization.jl", to maximize the detected area of union within the domain
3. Without clearing the cache, run "Main3_Path_Planning.jl", to generate optimal path for the aerial swarm across the epochs
